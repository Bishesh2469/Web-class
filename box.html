    <h1> this page is about box sizig</h1>
    <p> Certainly! In CSS, the box-sizing property is used to control how the total width and height of an element is calculated. By default, when you set the width and height of an element, it only includes the content of the element and does not account for padding, borders, or margins. This can sometimes lead to unexpected layout issues, especially when working with fixed layouts or when trying to create consistent spacing.

        The box-sizing property allows you to specify whether the width and height of an element should include its padding and border in addition to its content. There are typically two values for the box-sizing property:  
          1.content-box (default): This value makes the width and height of the element only include the content itself. Padding and border are added to the outside of the content area. This is the traditional box model behavior.
        
          box-sizing: content-box;


          2.border-box: This value makes the width and height of the element include the content, padding, and border. This means that the specified width and height will be applied to the entire box model, making it easier to create predictable layouts.

          box-sizing: border-box;
               

          Using border-box can be particularly helpful in responsive web design and grid layouts, as it allows you to more easily manage the overall size of elements without having to constantly adjust for padding and border widths. It's widely used in modern web development for its simplicity and predictability.
